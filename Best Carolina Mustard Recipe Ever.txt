2 cups yellow mustard
1/2 cup honey
1 cup apple cider vinegar
Squirt in some ketchup till the color looks good.
2-4 Tablespoons brown sugar
2-4 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
Salt and pepper to taste (start with 1 tsp each)
1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of hot sauce (use tomato based hot sauce for best results)

Good to note...I squirt and dump the ingredients, so measurments may be a bit off...but...just keep tasting it...once it tastes right, you are done!

Issues: 

1)	Single point of failure.  Bad motor controller made everything stop...including drivetrain.  
2)	In DrivetrainSubsystem we had a factor of 10000 we were dividing by.  This made it so it didn't turn.
3)	Wiring nuts are there because the breaker seems to be having some issues...may want to replace/move
4)	Shooter - Top bar chain is skippng...looks like our white spacer on the top bar may be on the wrong side
5)	1 intake motor turning the wrong way
6) 	RSL light stopped working....red wire popped out power supply to roborio 





Warnings - 
1)  The bottom roller is on the floor (carpet...not sure if it is actually on the floor). 
2)  The camera is dangling.  Will it stay in place after taking a hit?
3)  RoboRio wires aren't holding in the power supply very well
4)  Wireless communication kept dropping.  Redundant power supply recommended.
